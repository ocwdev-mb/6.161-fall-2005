The final project is a significant portion of the final grade. Students are required to design, analyze, and build an optical system of their choosing, which culminates into a final report of 15 to 20 pages in length. In addition, students are provided with a list of possible final projects and lab supervisors, lab equipment, and technical help as needed.

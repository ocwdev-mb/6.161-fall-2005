Textbooks and Reading Materials
-------------------------------

Some of the topics that we will cover are still areas of active research and are not yet treated in textbooks. Consequently, a combination of class notes and lecture slides will be provided on each topic. However, several of the basic concepts are covered in the following textbooks:

Goodman, Joseph W. _Introduction to Fourier Optics_. 3rd ed. Englewood, CO: Roberts and Co., 2005. ISBN: 0974707724.

Yariv, Amnon. _Optical Electronics in Modern Communications_. 5th ed. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1997. ISBN: 0195106261.

Saleh, B., and M. Teich. _Fundamentals of Photonics_. New York, NY: Wiley, 1991. ISBN: 0471839655.

Hecht, E. _Optics_. 4th ed. Reading, MA: Addison Wesley, 2002. ISBN: 0805385665.

Born, M., and E. Wolf. _Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light__._ 5th ed. New York, NY: Pergamon Press, 1975. ISBN: 0080180183

———. _Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light__._ 6th ed. New York, NY: Pergamon Press, 1980. ISBN: 0080264816.

———. _Principles of Optics: Electromagnetic Theory of Propagation, Interference and Diffraction of Light__._ 7th ed. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1999. ISBN: 0521639212.

Jenkins, F. A., and H. E. White. _Fundamentals of Optics_. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 1976. ISBN: 0070323305.

We strongly recommend you purchase the book by Hecht. Purchase of the other textbooks is not essential. They are intended for use as reference material. Please note that Hecht is a required book for 8.03, and Saleh is recommended for 6.631.

Portions of the material we will cover can also be found scattered throughout a number of journals and conference proceedings that include:

[Journal of the Optical Society of America](http://josaa.osa.org/Issue.cfm)

[Applied Optics](http://ao.osa.org/Issue.cfm)

[Optics Letters](http://ol.osa.org/)

[Applied Physics Letters](http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/apl)

[Optics Communications](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505711/description#description)

[Optical Engineering](http://spie.org/x867.xml)

[Proceedings of the Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)](http://spie.org/x1848.xml)

Occasionally, the student will be expected to read and apply material covered in articles selected from these journals.
